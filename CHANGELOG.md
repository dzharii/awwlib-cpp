Enhanced cross-platform CLI argument handling has been introduced with the addition of the `get_command_line_arguments` function in both Linux and Windows implementations, allowing for retrieval of command-line arguments while excluding the program name. On Windows, UTF-16 to UTF-8 conversion has been implemented to ensure robust argument parsing. This update also includes the addition of the `<vector>` header in `aww-os.hpp` to support the new functionality, along with minor codebase improvements such as resolving redundant namespace closing syntax in `aww-collection.hpp`. The changes are tagged with the identifier **#w9e1s4uq1xt** for tracking.



- [x] ðŸš©TODO: move `utf16_to_utf8` to aww-string
  - [x] Will keep it there, since it is for windows
- [x] ðŸš©TODO: I guess I can add tests for `get_command_line_arguments` aww tag #w9e1s4uq1xt only on Linux, since on windows it uses winapi call inside
  - [x] Also no, since it has a windows call
