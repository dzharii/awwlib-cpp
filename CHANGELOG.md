# AwwLib Changelog



## 2025-01-22 

Refactoring.

**`result_error` Struct Simplification**:
The `result_error` struct was updated to remove the `error_code` field. This revision narrows its scope to handling descriptive error messages, making the structure more concise and specialized.

**Test File Naming Update**:
A minor change was made to the `Generate-Files.ps1` script to rename generated test files. Test files now include the `-tests` suffix (e.g., `example-tests.cpp`) for clearer identification.

`awwy gen` now creates test files with `-tests` prefix; example: `aww-string-tests.cpp`

**Value Objects** in `include\aww-value-objects\aww-value-objects.hpp`

**Usage examples**: `tests\aww-value-objects\aww-value-objects.cpp`

**What's the Idea?**

Iâ€™ve added support for **value objects** to improve how we handle configuration values. Value objects are immutable and validate themselves when created, ensuring theyâ€™re always in a valid state. This means we no longer have to scatter validation logic across the codebaseâ€”itâ€™s all baked into the object itself.

This approach simplifies the code and avoids repetitive checks like ensuring numbers are positive or strings arenâ€™t empty. It also makes these values thread-safe since they canâ€™t be changed after creation.

**Example in Action**

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```cpp
class NonNegativeInt : public ValueObject<int> {
public:
    explicit NonNegativeInt(int value) : ValueObject(value) {
        if (value < 0) throw std::invalid_argument("Value must be non-negative");
    }
};

// Usage
NonNegativeInt positiveValue(42); // Works fine
NonNegativeInt invalidValue(-1); // Throws an exception
```

**Why Itâ€™s Useful**

This keeps the code clean and ensures every value is valid at creation. No surprises later and no redundant validation checks scattered around. Plus, immutability makes these values safe to copy and use anywhere. Check out the test file for more examples!



## 2025-01-10

Enhanced cross-platform CLI argument handling has been introduced with the addition of the `get_command_line_arguments` function in both Linux and Windows implementations, allowing for retrieval of command-line arguments while excluding the program name. On Windows, UTF-16 to UTF-8 conversion has been implemented to ensure robust argument parsing. This update also includes the addition of the `<vector>` header in `aww-os.hpp` to support the new functionality, along with minor codebase improvements such as resolving redundant namespace closing syntax in `aww-collection.hpp`. The changes are tagged with the identifier **#w9e1s4uq1xt** for tracking.



- [x] ðŸš©TODO: move `utf16_to_utf8` to aww-string
  - [x] Will keep it there, since it is for windows
- [x] ðŸš©TODO: I guess I can add tests for `get_command_line_arguments` aww tag #w9e1s4uq1xt only on Linux, since on windows it uses winapi call inside
  - [x] Also no, since it has a windows call
